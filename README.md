```markdown# Advanced XSS Scanner

Advanced XSS Scanner is a Python tool designed for identifying and testing websites for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It allows you to scan a single website or provide a text file containing multiple websites for sequential scanning.

Version 1.1

## Feature

- Collects internal URLs from a website recursively.
- Identifies and tests various points for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
- Handles websites with or without `http://` or `https://`.
- Provides colored output for clear visibility of results.
- Saves detected XSS vulnerabilities to a text file (`vulnerable_urls.txt`).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (can be installed using `pip`):
  - aiohttp
  - BeautifulSoup4
  - colorama

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dragonked2/EgyXss.git
   cd advanced-xss-scanner
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 colorama
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python egyxss.py
   ```

4. Choose one of the following options:
   - Scan a single website.
   - Provide a text file with multiple websites for sequential scanning.

5. Enter the maximum depth to crawl (e.g., 2).

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to proceed with the scanning.

## Sample Payloads

The tool comes with a list of basic payloads, payloads without angle brackets, additional WAF bypass payloads, and additional payloads for character restrictions. You can customize this list in the script to suit your needs.

## Results

The tool will display the results on the terminal, highlighting vulnerable URLs and form fields with potential XSS vulnerabilities. Detected vulnerabilities will also be saved to `vulnerable_urls.txt` for further analysis.
